<p><strong>Baker &amp; Mckenzie - Chicago, IL - (Feb 2017 - Present)</strong> Security Architect (SOAR) - Migrated on-prem Tenable SC to cloud-based Tenable IO. Utilized the Tenable IO REST API to fully automated creation, deletion and updates of all IO resources using Python playbooks for a global enterprise of 20,000+ assets and 200+ scan definitions. - Wrote Python scripts to pull vulnerability data from SC and IO, parse based on office location/application, and create tickets for system owners where the systems were in scope for ISO 27001. Application kept a state table to prevent duplication of tickets, and removed entries from the state table based on PluginID and IP address once the vulnerability was mitigated. - Wrote Python scripts to pull vulnerability data from SC and IO and report severity metrics for all repositories in the enterprise. Automated creation a quarterly report in Excel format using the Python Libary XLSXWriter. - Federated single-server IBM QRadar deployment to have multiple event processors across continents. - Created and maintained a security metrics schema for all security products in their native format. Metrics were parsed with Python scripts into the common schema and imported into RSA’s Archer for visualization and analysis. - Mentored IR (Incident Response) analysts in their roles and on technologies such as Tenable IO/SC and IBM QRadar to servce as backup SME’s (Subject Matter Experts).</p>
