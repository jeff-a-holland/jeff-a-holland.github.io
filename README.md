Work Experience
---------------
**Baker & Mckenzie - Chicago, IL - (Feb 2017 - Present)**
Security Architect (SOAR)
- Migrated on-prem Tenable SC to cloud-based Tenable IO. Utilized the Tenable IO REST API to fully automated creation, deletion and updates of all IO resources using Python playbooks for a global enterprise of 20,000+ assets and 200+ scan definitions.
- Wrote Python scripts to pull vulnerability data from SC and IO, parse based on office/application location, and create tickets for system owners where the systems were in scope for ISO 27001. Application kept a state table to prevent duplication of tickets, and removed entries from the state table based on PluginID and IP address once the vulnerability was mitigated.
- Wrote Python scripts to pull vulnerability data from SC and IO and report severity metrics for all repositories in the enterprise. Automated creation a quarterly report in Excel format using the Python Libary XLSXWriter.
- Federated single-server IBM QRadar deployment to have multiple event processors across continents.
- Created and maintained a security metrics schema for all security products in their native format. Metrics were parsed with Python script into a common schema and imported into RSA's Archer for visualization.
- Mentored IR (Incident Response) analysts in their roles and on technologies such as Tenable IO/SC and IBM QRadar to servce as backup SME's (Subject Matter Experts).
